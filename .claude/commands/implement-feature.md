Implement a given feature plan

If no feature plan is given then provide the user with the latest 3 feature plans under /docs/featurePlans

# Git

Implementing a feature plan should always be done on a new branch that is not the 'master' or 'main' branch.
Create and switch to a new branch named 'feature/<description>' where <description> comes from the plan name.

Immediately after implementing the plan create a new commit with a message that begins using the robot emoji (🤖)
to denote this code was created using AI, and include all the files that were changed during the implementation
as well as the feature plan doc as well. The commit message should use a 1-line summary at the top,
leave an empty line, and then implementation details via bullet points.
